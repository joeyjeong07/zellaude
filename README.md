# Zellaude

A Zellij status bar plugin that replaces the default tab bar with Claude Code and Codex activity awareness.

![Zellaude status bar example](assets/bar-example.svg)

## Features

- **Full tab bar** — shows all Zellij tabs (not just agent sessions), replacing the native tab bar
- **Session & mode display** — shows the Zellij session name and current input mode (NORMAL, LOCKED, PANE, etc.) with color-coded indicators
- **Live activity indicators** — see what every Claude Code and Codex session is doing at a glance; non-agent tabs shown dimly
- **Clickable tabs** — click any tab to switch to it
- **Smart pane focus** — clicking an agent-aware tab focuses its most recently active Claude Code or Codex pane, revealing it inside a stack; waiting (⚠) sessions retain priority
- **Permission flash** — sessions pulse bright yellow for 2 seconds when a permission request arrives
- **Desktop notifications** — macOS notification on permission requests (rate-limited to once per 10s per tab), with click-to-focus support via [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier)
- **Elapsed time** — shows how long a session has been in its current state (after 30s), making it easy to spot stuck sessions
- **Multi-instance sync** — all Zellij tabs show a unified view of all sessions

### Settings

Click the **Zellaude** prefix on the left side of the bar to open the settings menu. Click it again (or the `×` button) to close. Settings are persisted to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.json`.

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Notifications | Always / Unfocused / Off | Always | Desktop notifications on permission requests. "Unfocused" only notifies when the requesting pane is on a different tab. |
| Flash | Persist / Brief / Off | Brief | Yellow flash on permission requests. "Persist" keeps flashing until resolved, "Brief" flashes for 2 seconds. |
| Elapsed time | On / Off | On | Show time since last activity (appears after 30s). |

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — used by the hook script at runtime

### Quick install

Add the plugin to your Zellij layout — that's it:

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="https://github.com/ishefi/zellaude/releases/latest/download/zellaude.wasm"
    }
    children
}
```

On first load, the plugin automatically installs the hook script and registers it with Claude Code and Codex. No cloning, no install scripts.

[Codex requires a one-time review](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks) before running newly installed user hooks. Start Codex, open `/hooks`, inspect the Zellaude handlers, and trust them.

### Build from source

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (in addition to the above)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishefi/zellaude.git
cd zellaude
./install.sh
```

This builds the WASM plugin and copies it to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/`. Hook registration happens automatically when the plugin loads.

Then add the plugin to your Zellij layout (replaces the default tab bar):

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude.wasm"
    }
    children
}
```

Or try the included layout directly:

```bash
zellij --layout layout.kdl
```

### Optional: click-to-focus notifications

For desktop notifications that focus the right pane when clicked, install [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier):

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Without it, notifications still appear via osascript but clicking them won't focus the pane.

## Uninstall

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall
```

## How it works

Two components:

1. **WASM plugin** — runs inside Zellij, receives events, maintains state in memory, renders the status bar, and sends desktop notifications. On first load, it writes the hook script to `~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh` and registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
2. **Hook script** — a thin bash bridge that forwards Claude Code and Codex hook events to the plugin via `zellij pipe`

```
Claude Code / Codex hook → zellaude-hook.sh → zellij pipe → plugin → render
```

The hook script and registration are version-tagged and updated automatically when the plugin version changes.
The registered hook command uses `${HOME}/.config/zellij/plugins/zellaude-hook.sh`; Claude Code expands `${HOME}` when it runs hooks, keeping the settings entry portable across machines.

All state lives in WASM memory. No temp files, no race conditions. Multiple plugin instances (one per tab) sync state automatically via inter-plugin messaging. Sessions are cleaned up automatically when tabs are closed.
