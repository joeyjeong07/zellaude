### Settings menu width with the Rainbow row
- Reported by impl2 during T7. The menu never clipped to the bar's width; that predates the branch. The new Rainbow row widens it from 116 to 131 visible columns, so on bars narrower than ~131 columns the close × falls off the right edge (before: below 116). Clicking the Zellaude prefix still closes the menu.
- Options, ranked:
  1. (rec) Accept, propose a seed — no scope beyond T7's pinned change; the menu still closes from the prefix / the × is hidden on 116–131-column bars.
  2. Fix now: clip the menu so the × stays visible — removes the regression / a render.rs layout change outside the pinned design.
  3. Shorten the Rainbow label — less growth / cannot win back the 15 columns, and only cosmetic.
- Selected: 1 — the branch's goal is CPU and latency, the lost × has a working alternative, and the root cause (no clip) is older than this branch.

### Session-template docs follow T8
- Raised by impl2-crit1 at T8. Two dated docs say templates compile "once per plugin instance": `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-session-templates-design.md:165-166` and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-session-templates.md:7`. After T8 that is false. The repo treats these docs as live (f6d0ec9 corrected one when behavior changed).
- Options, ranked:
  1. (rec) Fix both sentences inside T8 — the docs stay true, and nobody else owns `docs/` / two files outside the board's T8 list.
  2. Leave them — no scope change / the docs then describe behavior that no longer exists.
- Selected: 1, with impl2's sentence-only wording.
