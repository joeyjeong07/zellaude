### Settings menu width with the Rainbow row
- Reported by impl2 during T7. The menu never clipped to the bar's width; that predates the branch. The new Rainbow row widens it from 116 to 131 visible columns, so on bars narrower than ~131 columns the close × falls off the right edge (before: below 116). Clicking the Zellaude prefix still closes the menu.
- Options, ranked:
  1. (rec) Accept, propose a seed — no scope beyond T7's pinned change; the menu still closes from the prefix / the × is hidden on 116–131-column bars.
  2. Fix now: clip the menu so the × stays visible — removes the regression / a render.rs layout change outside the pinned design.
  3. Shorten the Rainbow label — less growth / cannot win back the 15 columns, and only cosmetic.
- Selected: 1 — the branch's goal is CPU and latency, the lost × has a working alternative, and the root cause (no clip) is older than this branch.
